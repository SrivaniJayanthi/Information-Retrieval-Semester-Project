In this repository, you will find a comprehensive Python notebook that covers a wide range of concepts in **Information Retrieval**. The notebook includes detailed implementations of the following key topics:

- **Tokenization**  
- **Stop Word Removal**  
- **Inverted Index Construction**  
- **Positional Indexing**  
- **Tri-Grams**  
- **Soundex Algorithm**  
- **Handling Misspelled Words using Edit Distance**  
- **Block Sort-Based Indexing (BSBI)**  
- **Single-Pass In-Memory Indexing (SPIMI)**  
- **Comparison between BSBI and SPIMI**  
- **Map and Reduce Functions**  
- **TF-IDF Ranking Implementation**  

For a clear understanding of the concepts and step-by-step implementation, refer to the [Eval1](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Information-Retrieval-Semester-Project/blob/main/Eval1.ipynb) notebook, which provides structured explanations and examples for each concept. <br>
This is a research paper about the data set - [IR-1184](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Information-Retrieval-Semester-Project/blob/main/IR-1184.pdf). <br>
This PPT helps you understand the flow and will be useful for presentation purpose - [Reference PPT](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Information-Retrieval-Semester-Project/blob/main/Reference%20PPT.pptx).<br>
Other files are the data set files, you can use them in your code referenceing [Eval1](https://github.com/SrivaniJayanthi/Information-Retrieval-Semester-Project/blob/main/Eval1.ipynb). Do not forget to change the paths accordingly.
