===================================

This data is prepared based on 200 queries of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2000-2003 campaign for bilingual ad-hoc retrieval tracks (http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-E0008/). The Swahili and Somali queries are the translation of english queries from C001-C200 topic set. We hired a translation organization to translate title and description of each topic into Somali and Swahili. For more information please refer to the published paper.
